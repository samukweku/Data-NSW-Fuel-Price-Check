This is a data cleaning process on data I scraped from NSW Fuel Price Dataset.

I scraped this site

https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/fuel-check

and did some cleanups before outputting the data.

*Please Note

1. The csv files are not included as they are quite large

2. Relative paths are used here, so please replace the file paths with where You wish to point the download to.
