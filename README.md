This is a data science project that illustrates how to obtain data from the web, do some cleanups, and store it in a relational database. 

The data is open source and the website is : https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/fuel-check.

There are two scripts - NSW_Fuel_Prices.md, which is written in R and Scrape_Clean_Store.ipynb which is written in Python.
